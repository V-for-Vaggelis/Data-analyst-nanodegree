    "* The WeRateDogs Twitter archive, provided as a csv file called **twitter-archive-enhanced.csv**\n",
    "* The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. These data are hosted in the Udacity servers and accessed through an http request. The response is a tsv file called **image_predictions.tsv**\n",
    "* Each tweet's retweet count and favorite (\"like\") count, accessed through twitter's API and stored programmatically in a txt file.\n"

    "* __Seems like a combination of a doggo and a puppo is irresistable since it's by far the most likeable. The \"pupper\" is the less liked state, despite being the most common.__\n"
